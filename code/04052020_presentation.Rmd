# The Cost of Cancer Care and Cost-related Nonadherence


# Study Objectives
1. Determine the prevalence of CRN in patients with lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer or lymphoma

2. Determine whether CRN is associated with lower cancer-specific survival/mortality for patients with lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer or lymphoma.


# National Health Interview Survey
> - Nationally representative multistage probability sample conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC
   - ~100,000 individuals interviewed each year
   - Low income and minority households oversampled; individuals with health conditions of interest (including cancer) oversampled within households

# Study Sample
> - Individuals reporting a diagnosis of breast, prostate, lung, colon/rectal cancer or lymphoma 
    - Diagnosed in past 10 years (in attempt to restrict to "current" cases)
> - All diagnoses are self-reported; no information about stage/subtype
> - Excluded those who were ineligible for follow-up (insufficient identifying information provided, younger than age 18)


# Exposure
- **Cost-related nonadherence**
  - 3 questions asking participants if, in order to cut costs, they had:
    - Needed but could not afford prescription medications in the last 12 months?
    - Skipped medication doses?
    - Delayed taking medication doses?
    - Neglected to fill prescription?
  - Coded CRN as **any yes**


# Outcome
- **Cancer-specific survival/mortality**
  - Record linkage to the National Death Index
    - NCHS used probabilistic matching to ascertain cause of death (ICD-10 codes)
  - Not all respondents were eligbile for record linkage: under age 18, insufficient identifying information, no provided SSN, etc.
  - Follow-up time = Date of interview - final day in quarter/year when death was ascertained (because exact dates not available)

# Statistical Analysis, Pt 1
>- All analyses conducted in R 3.6.1 and RStudio 1.2.5019
>- Given unequal sampling probabilities and probable selection bias for mortality-elgible participants, we adjusted all analyses for survey design using the `survey` package in R
>- T tests/Wilcoxon rank sign tests and Rao-Scott Chi-square tests comparing patients experiencing CRN to those not experiencing CRN:
  -Age, Sex, Race, Health Insurance Type, Education, vital status

# Statistical Analysis, Pt 2
>- Cox proportional hazards models: unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, and years since diagnosis
 - One set of models collapsing across sites, another stratified by site [breast and prostate models not adjusted for sex]
 - Checked models for proportional hazards, linearity, influential cases
 - Violated proportional hazard: estimated HR separately for those with <= median follow-up time and those with > median follow-up time

# Assumptions: Proportional Hazards
- All models with the exception of unadjusted lymphoma and adjusted lung cancer met the assumption of proportional hazards (p > 0.05)
- Note that log likelihood for lymphoma model converged too early indicating we might not have enough cases
- Graphical inspection of models not meeting assumption did not show substantial deviation from a constant hazard, however:

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
library(cowplot)
library(patchwork)
library(magick)

#show the zph plots (at least for the CRN variable)
p1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("ly_zph.png", scale = 0.9)
p2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("lu_zph.png", scale = 0.9)

p1 + p2
```

# Estimating Hazard Ratios By Time Period
- For models that violated PH assumption, we estiamted HR (95% CI in those follow-up for less than versus greater than the median)
- After stratifying, there weren't enough lymphoma death cases to run models
- For lung cancer, those followed up for <=129 weeks with CRN had a 20% higher hazard of death (95% CI = 0.72 - 2.00) 
- Those followed for > 129 weeks with CRN had a 19% lower hazard of death (95% CI = 0.36 - 1.82)

# Results After Removing Potentially Influential Cases

res2 %>% knitr::kable() %>% kableExtra::kable_styling("striped")
```

# Linearity
> - The assumption of linearity (for age, the sole continuous variable) was met

# Discussion
> - CRN was generally not associated with cancer mortality- if anything it would be protective (except for lung and prostate cancer)
> - Removing influential cases took away the majority of cases with CRN + estimates were unstable, so the inverse associations observed in those cases should be interpreted with caution
> - Why? Something for further exploration but could have to do with which treatments individuals skipped, age, other omitted variables which we did not have access to (e.g. cancer type, income)
> - Hasn't been previous literature of CRN and mortality, but results aren't consistent with medical bankruptcy/mortality results --> possible that CRN is more mild form of financial distress?


# Strengths + Limitations
> -Strengths: Follow-up for eligible cases was complete, population-representative sample, inclusion of multiple cancer subtypes makes a case for a more generalizable finding
> - Limitations: Unable to adjust for all potential confounders [unmeasured], in some cases a limited sample size, self-report may be subject to bias, possible selection bias if cancer cases with CRN died early and weren't surveyed
> - Future directions: other types of rarer cancers that have higher cost could be analyzed (e.g. bladder), studies with full assessment of confounders
