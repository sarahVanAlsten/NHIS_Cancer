# Overview
> - Background
> - Objectives
> - Methods
> - Results
> - Conclusion

# United States Cancer Burden
> - Nearly 2 million new cases annually
> - Second leading cause of death (~ 600,000)
> - Incidence + death rate falling, but socioeconomic gaps remain
> ![](nattinger_2017_medcare_bc_ses_death.jpg)

# The Cost of Cancer Care 
> - More than 50% cancer patients have financial difficulty affording treatment or medication
> - Preventable cancers associated with higher treatment costs
> - Around 12% cancer patients rationed drugs received in order to cut costs (cost-related nonadherence)
> - Most cancer meds costs > $100,000/yr (4x higher than average cost to treat other chronic illnesses)


# More About Cost-Related Nonadherence
- Nonadherence = an individual doesn't follow through physician recommended plan for care

- Cost-related nonadherence (CRN)= primary reason for nonadherence is secondary to cost + financial barriers


# Study Objectives
1. Determine the prevalence of CRN in patients with lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer or lymphoma

2. Determine whether CRN is associated with lower cancer-specific survival/mortality for patients with lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer or lymphoma.


# National Health Interview Survey
- Nationally representative multistage probability sample conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC
- ~100,000 individuals interviewed each year
- Low income and minority households oversampled; individuals with health conditions of interest (including cancer) oversampled within households

# Study Sample
- Individuals reporting a diagnosis of breast, prostate, lung, colon/rectal cancer or lymphoma 
- Diagnosed in past 10 years (in attempt to restrict to "current" cases)
- All diagnoses are self-reported


# Exposure
- Cost-related nonadherence
  - 3 questions asking participants if, in order to cut costs, they had:
    - Skipped medication doses?
    - Delayed taking medication doses?
    - Neglected to fill prescription?
- Needed but could not afford prescription medications in the last 12 months?
  - Coded CRN as **any yes**


# Outcome
- Cancer-specific survival/mortality
  - Record linkage to the National Death Index with ICD-10 codes
  - Not all respondents were eligbile for record linkage, excluded those under age 18, insufficient identifying information, no provided SSN, etc.
  - Follow-up time = Date of interview - final day in quarter/year when death was ascertained (because exact dates not available)

# Statistical Analysis, Pt 1
>- All analyses conducted in R 3.6.1 and RStudio 1.2.5019
>- Given unequal sampling probabilities we adjusted all analyses for survey design using the `survey` package in R
>- T tests and Chi-square tests comparing confounders in patients experiencing CRN to those not experiencing CRN

# Statistical Analysis, Pt 2
- Cox proportional hazards models: unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, and years since diagnosis
- One set of models collapsing across sites, another stratified by site [breast and prostate models not adjusted for sex]
- Checked models for proportional hazards, linearity, influential cases

# Assumptions: Proportional Hazards
- All models with the exception of unadjusted lymphoma and adjusted lung cancer met the assumption of proportional hazards (p > 0.05)
- Graphical inspection of models not meeting assumption did not show substantial deviation from a constant hazard, however

```{r, echo = FALSE,message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning = FALSE,fig.align='center'}
library(cowplot)
library(patchwork)
library(magick)

#show the zph plots (at least for the CRN variable)
p1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("ly_zph.png", scale = 0.9)
p2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image("lu_zph.png", scale = 0.9)

p1 + p2
```

# Assumptions: Linearity and Influential Cases
- The assumption of linearity (for age, the sole continuous variable) was met
- Influential Cases: After removing potentially influential cases, there weren't enough cases for models to converge
- Generally, the only anomolous feature of influential cases was short follow up time, so we retained them in final models

# Discussion
- CRN was generally not associated with cancer mortality- if anything it would be protective (except for lung and prostate cancer)
- Removing influential cases took away the majority of cases with CRN + estimates were unstable, so the inverse associations observed in those cases should be interpreted with caution
- Why? Something for further exploration but could have to do with which treatments individuals skipped, age, other omitted variables which we did not have access to (e.g. cancer type, income)
- Hasn't been previous literature of CRN and mortality, but results aren't consistent with medical bankruptcy/mortality results --> possible that CRN is more mild form of financial distress?


# Strengths + Limitations
- Strengths: Follow-up for eligible cases was complete, population-representative sample, inclusion of multiple cancer subtypes makes a case for a more generalizable finding
- Limitations: Unable to adjust for all potential confounders [unmeasured], in some cases a limited sample size, self-report may be subject to bias, possible selection bias if cancer cases with CRN died early and weren't surveyed
- Future directions: other types of rarer cancers that have higher cost could be analyzed (e.g. bladder), studies with full assessment of confounders
