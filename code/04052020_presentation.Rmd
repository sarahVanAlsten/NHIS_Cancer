# United States Cancer Burden
> - Nearly 2 million new cases annually
> - Second leading cause of death (~ 600,000)
> - Incidence + death rate falling, but socioeconomic gaps remain

# SES and Cancer


# The Cost of Cancer Care


# Cost-related Nonadherence


# Study Objectives
1. Determine the prevalence of CRN in patients with lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer or lymphoma

2. Determine whether CRN is associated with lower cancer-specific survival for patients with lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer or lymphoma.


# National Health Interview Survey
> - Nationally representative multistage probability sample conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the CDC
   - ~100,000 individuals interviewed each year
   - Low income and minority households oversampled; individuals with health conditions of interest (including cancer) oversampled within households

# Study Sample


# Exposure
- **Cost-related nonadherence**
  - 3 questions asking participants if, in order to cut costs, they had:
    - Needed but could not afford prescription medications in the last 12 months?
    - Skipped medication doses?
    - Delayed taking medication doses?
    - Neglected to fill prescription?
  - Coded CRN as **any yes**


# Outcome
- **Cancer-specific survival/mortality**
  - Record linkage to the National Death Index
    - NCHS used probabilistic matching to ascertain cause of death (ICD-10 codes)
  - Not all respondents were eligbile for record linkage: under age 18, insufficient identifying information, no provided SSN, etc.
  - Follow-up time = Date of interview - final day in quarter/year when death was ascertained (because exact dates not available)

# Statistical Analysis, Pt 1
>- All analyses conducted in R 3.6.1 and RStudio 1.2.5019
>- Given unequal sampling probabilities and probable selection bias for mortality-elgible participants, we adjusted all analyses for survey design using the `survey` package in R
>- T tests/Wilcoxon rank sign tests and Rao-Scott Chi-square tests comparing patients experiencing CRN to those not experiencing CRN:
  -Age, Sex, Race, Health Insurance Type, Education, Smoking, BMI, vital status

# Statistical Analysis, Pt 2
>- Cox proportional hazards models: unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, and years since diagnosis
 - One set of models collapsing across sites, another stratified by site [breast and prostate models not adjusted for sex]
 - Checked models for proportional hazards, linearity, influential cases
 - Violated proportional hazard: estimated HR separately for those with <= median follow-up time and those with > median follow-up time
